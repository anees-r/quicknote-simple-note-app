# simple_note_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I have masked my API keys and other sensitive data in my .env file and that data is read using flutter_dotenv package. You can simply regenerate your firebase_options file or paste your credentials in the place of masking variables. Thanks!

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
